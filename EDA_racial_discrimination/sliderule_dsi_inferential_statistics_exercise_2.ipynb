    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "In 2004, Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan performed an experiment where they sent out resumes with randomly selected 'black' and 'white' sounding names. Based on their data, it was found that resumes with white sounding names get called back 50%(+/-0.04%) more often than ones with black sounding names. The results were significant. This indications that there is a bias against applicants with black sounding names on job applications.\n",

    "Since other factors, such as education or experiences, were not considered. Therefore it cannot be said that race/name was the most important factor. There would have to be second analysis where these other factors are considered. Alternitively, a linear or logical regression model including using all the known factors  could be performed and the importances of each varable could be determined from the weights.  "
